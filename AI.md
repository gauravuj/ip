CHATGPT 

- I was really excited about bringing some new techniques into my project, 
  but I hit a snagâ€”I wasn't sure how to execute them. I turned to GPT for some guidance,
  especially when it came to incorporating different dialog box colors in my classes. 
  Initially, I thought creating two separate labels would do the trick, but that didn't pan 
  out as I hoped. Then, I figured maybe using two distinct fxml files along with DialogBox 
  would solve my problem, but that just led to more complications in my code. That's when I 
  decided to ask GPT for a better way to achieve what I wanted without having to juggle multiple 
  fxml files for each dialog box. What I learned from this experience was eye-opening. 
  There's often more than one way to approach a problem, and getting a fresh perspective 
  can really elevate your original idea.

- I am still learning JavaFX and there were some points, where I didn't understand what to do.
  So, I used GPT to help me make sense of the code and as well tell me of methods that will enhance 
  my User Interface (UI). One thing that I learned is how it saves me so much time in looking for 
  explanations on the internet and methods that I want to use but have no idea how. Usually when I search on google, stackflow 
they provide me code that I fully don't understand and it confuses me more. With GPT, I can ask it to explain me the code like I am five.
It also helped me refine my thoughts and structure my UI in a way that is more appealing.
